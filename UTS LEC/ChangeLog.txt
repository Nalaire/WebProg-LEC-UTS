Admin + DB harusnya aman
Public lom kelar
ad README, tambahan change log disana kalo niat

change Log1:
1. dashboard.php (header('Location: ../login.php) changed to header('Location: ../public/login.php') as the file login.php does not directly exist within /utslec/ directory)

change log2:
1. config.php(added pdo method of calling the server)
2. removed utslec.sql (since it seems like it did not get used)
3. change log1 is cancelled, login.php is added to utslec instead

5. add login_process in utslec/ from the ground up
6. added register and register process in utslec/ from the ground up
7. reworked the dashboard system, because the previous dashboard system is not the same as what the professor told us to make. (but the legacy version will be left untouch and accessible for now)
8. admin temporary feature: debug_mode (allow access to some stuff the admin is not meant to access, this feature might get removed)

change log3:
1. admin/dashboard.php (admin verification is now done by first going through 'defined' check, then if its value is true, but since MySQL Boolean is consisting of 0 and 1, and php '!== true' will only accept data type that is true instead of 1, so i swapped true with 1)

2. includes/navbar.php(removing session_start())
3. utslec/dashboard.php (inserted all the admin button links)

8. complete modificaton on event detail to accept the new table design.
9. (! NEED TESTING) attempt to format event detail
10. (! NEED TESTING) fix the flaw in which query failed because modification on id
11. (NEW FEATURE) added Updated At details feature i guess... update_at can now be null, and event detail dont mention update unless if someone actually made an update on the event.
12. navbar include file split into 2, the navbar2.php is used in user folder or admin folder because of the dot DX
